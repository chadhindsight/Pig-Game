# Pig-Game
## 1. My version of a game created by Jonas Schmedtmann. It uses javascript to manipulate the DOM.
## 2. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
## 3. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
## 4. If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
## 5. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
## 6. The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game.
